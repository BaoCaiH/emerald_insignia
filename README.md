# emerald_insignia

I need a decent D&D board online + I like Fire Emblem 2D asthetic = this

"This" is built with [PixiJs](https://pixijs.com/) because I couldn't figure HTML Canvas out even for my dear life. Also, they do it better, I just want to make this thing playable, why bother.

## Setup:

`npm install`

## Run:

`npm run start`

## Giving credits where credit's due

Enormous thanks to [Drew](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrewConley) and his fantastic Pizza Legends [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcjhmZ8oLT0r9dSiIK6RB_PuBWlG1KSq_) as a very comprehensive guide double as a project roadmap.

Truly, I've started to make things so many time (so many private and dead repos..), finally something tangible.

### Sprites and Tilesets

And of course this thing looks like Fire Emblem from Nintendo but I don't know how to get assets from GBA so..

Your one and only [**The Spriter Resource**](https://www.spriters-resource.com/).

Game sprites and map [here](https://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/fireemblemtheblazingblade/).

Lyn sprite from [Grim](https://www.spriters-resource.com/submitter/Grim/).

Hector sprite from [FEPlanet.net](http://www.feplanet.net/sprites-archive-overworld-sheets/7/595), because for some reason his map sprites were missing from Spriter..

And this gigachad, [Feaw](https://feuniverse.us/u/feaw/summary), for creating more tilesets than I can learn how to use [them](https://feuniverse.us/t/tilesets-and-palettes/945).
